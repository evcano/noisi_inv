# At the equator, 1 degree of latitude is approx. 110.5 km
# grid_lat_min: minimum lat in degrees (-90 - 90) 
# grid_lat_max: maximum lat in degrees (-90 - 90)
# grid_lon_min: minimum lon in degrees (-180 - 180)
# grid_lon_max: maximum lon in degrees (-180 - 180)
# synt_data: specify if your synthetics shall be displacement
#                (DIS), velocity (VEL) or acceleration (ACC)
# wavefield_type: set here the type of wavefield you want to use: 
# -- membrane (analytic Green's function for homogeneous membrane wave)
# -- instaseis (use instaseis; need to specify the path to the instaseis
#    database as wavefield_path)
# -- custom (you need to prepare your own wave field if this is set, and
#    specify the path to the files as wavefield_path)
# wavefield_path: set here the path to instaseis database or your wavefield
# database from another solver (not needed for analytic Green's functions)
