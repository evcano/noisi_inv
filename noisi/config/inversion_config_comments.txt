# inversion_config.yml mostly contains the parameters from config.yml, source_config.yml, source_setup_parameters.yml, and measr_config.yml
# It can be used to either automatically run the forward simulation for a given distribution
# Or run a gradient-based iterative inversion. 

### Additional parameters
# output_folder: path to where the project should be saved
# stationlist: Path to stationlist. If no stationlist is given and download_data is true, a stationlist will be created. 
# add_metadata: If only forward simulation is run, this should be set to true
# add_noise: adds 5% of the rms of all cross-correlations to simulate noise
# output_plot: plots the output

## data_download parameters
# NOTE: If a stationlist is given only data for those stations will be downloaded (or attempted to)
# download_data: set to true if data should be downloaded
# download_data_date: can be either 'yesterday' or date in yyyy-mm-dd format
# download_data_channels: Set list of channels that should be downloaded, wildcards accepted (e.g. ['*Z','*E'] or ['BHZ'])
# min_station_dist: minimum distance between station pairs (in degrees)
# domain_type: one of circular, rectangular, global
## if domain_type is circular:
# circ_lat_center: latitude of centre of circle
# circ_lon_center: longitude of centre of circle
# circ_radius_min: minimum radius of circle (in degrees)
# circ_radius_max: maximum radius of circle (in degrees)
## if domain_type is rectangular:
# rect_lat_min: minimum latitude
# rect_lat_max: maximum latitude
# rect_lon_min: minimum longitude
# rect_lon_max: maximum longitude

## inversion parameters
# observed_corr: path to observed cross-correlations. If no path is given only the forward simulation will be performed
# opt_statpair: Optimum station pair file (.csv) can be given here, only those will be copied from observed_corr. Format: NET.STA.LOC.CHA--NET.STA.LOC.CHA with sta_pair as header
# snr_thresh: Signal-to-noise ratio threshold for copying observed correlations. Computed using maximum in surface wave arrival window divided by standard deviation of the whole time series. (e.g. 4)
# corr_max_dist: maximum distance between the station pairs (in degrees)
# nr_iterations: Number of iterations for the inversion
# nr_step_tests: Number of step tests for each iteration
# step_test_smoothing: Tests if the misfit of the updated model is below the previous misfit. If not, smoothing is reduced in steps of 0.5 (degrees)
# frac_corr_slt: fraction of correlations that is used for the step length test, e.g. 2 means 1/2 of the correlations are used
# step_length_min: minimum step length that will be tested 
# step_length_max: maximum step length that will be tested
# step_smooth: list of iterations and smoothing (in degrees). [[iteration1,smoothing1],[iteration2,smoothing2],[iteration3,smoothing3],....]
# Up to iteration1 (could be iteration number 2 or 3), smoothing1 will be used. Afterwards smoothing2 will be used up to iteration2 etc.


## wavefield parameters
# see config_comments.txt for details. If wavefield_type analytic, the following parameters have to be set:
# v: analytic surface wave speed
# q: analytic attenuation factor q
# rho: analytic density
